## Problem Statement
Our Problem is to identify the polarity of tweets[positive,negative or neutral] given a bunch of tweets over the year on Twitter

## Dataset
I have used the [Tweet Sentiment Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/data) from Kaggle for this project.

### Workflow

**Data Visualization**

**Questions Answered during Data Visualization!!**
- What is the tweet length distribution?
- What are the number of short tweets? What is their polarity?
- What is the distribution of word counts?

**Model Building**
I built the model on the [SARS COV-2 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/all-covid19-vaccines-tweets) from Kaggle.

* Models Used

- Single LSTM
- Bidirectional LSTM
