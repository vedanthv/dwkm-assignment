## How to use Outlier Analysis in Telecom Domain?

### Problem 
There are lot of problems in the telecom domain that involve the extensive use of Machine Learning but Customer Churn Prediction is one of the main issues and needs a concreate solution that can avoid outliers to build better models. 

### Objective
In this project, I'm going to use various types of Outlier Dection Techniques to improve the alreadsy existing customer churn data.

### Data
The data is taken from two sources

1. [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
2. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

### Methods Applied Fpr Outlier Detection
* Tukey's IQR method
* Standard deviation method
* Z-score method
* Modified z-score
* Isolation Forest
* DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
